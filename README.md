## 📣 IMPORTANT
⚠️ **Start this tool *before* launching Roblox!**  
The app hooks into your display context (DC) for fast pixel scanning and screen-space accuracy.  
Launching Roblox first can cause misalignment or missed pixel reads during automation — especially in high-speed minigames like lockpicking or glass cutting.

---


## ▶️ How to Use
1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases](../../releases) page.  
2. **Extract** and run `ERLCAutoRobTool.exe`.  
3. Ensure **Roblox is closed**, then start the tool.  
4. Once the UI opens, launch Roblox.  
5. Use the on-screen buttons or **CTRL + number** hotkeys to start a robbery.  
6. Cooldowns and sound notifications will handle the rest!
